      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2); //will show 200 and 100

      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = "Wesley";

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      console.log(team); //will update Poppy to Lux
      console.log(players); // will ALSO update Poppy to Lux;
      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "Lux";
      console.log(team2); //will show Lux
      console.log(players); //will show Poppy

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      console.log(team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team3[3] = "Bob";
      team4[3] = "Marley";
      team5[3] = "Ed";
      console.log(team3);
      console.log(team4);
      console.log(team5);
      console.log(players);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      //captain.age = 99;
      console.log(captain);
      console.log(person); //it is alsoupdates

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
      console.log(cap2);
      console.log(person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      //const cap3 = {...person};

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      console.log(wes);

      // dev.social.twitter = "@coolest";
      console.log(dev);
      console.log(wes); // for some reason updated TOO!! You need to clone every level!

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //not recommended method
      dev2.social.twitter = "@coolest";
